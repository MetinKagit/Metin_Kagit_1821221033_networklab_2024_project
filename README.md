# Computer Network Lecture Project:

This is a Computer Network lecture project that, I create "Project Management Program" by using Java socket and thread programming.

- Project has two sides one is the Server side and the other is the client side.
- The server side runs on a cloud server and clients can connect to the server and create or login users. Then, they can create or join a project. Also, they chat with each other.
- I use Mysql as a database to store user, project and message information. The database runs on a cloud server like the server side.
