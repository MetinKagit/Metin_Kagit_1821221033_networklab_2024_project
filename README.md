# Computer Network Lecture Project:

This is a Computer Network lecture project that, I create "Project Management Program" by using Java socket and thread programming.

- Project has two side one is Server side and the other is client side.
- Server side run on a cloud server and clients can connect the server and create or login user. Then, they can create or join project. Also they chat each others.
- I use Mysql as a database to store user, project and message information. Database runs on a cloud server like server side.
